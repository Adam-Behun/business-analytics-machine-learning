# Review

- Linear regression
- Logistic regression - binary classification


# Decision Tree - Introduction

- applied to both regression, and classification problems
- explains what is happening with the data
- we have inputs and the outputs and we are tryin
- g to find the process (the function)

- in ML my input is the input and output, and the process is what the actual output is
- how is the program getting the output is the objective
- w.r.t features
- information enthropy and relation to thermodynamics
- amount of info - what gives me more information?

100% is more info, 50-50 is less information. If all like pepsi, I have all the rules I need to get my formula. 

Enthropy measure -- which node is going to be the first one
Enthropy relates to assymetry. The first one is the one creating the most assymetry. 

Decision tree is using the enthropy measure to build the tree step by step. Then, we can run new data through the tree. 

We use decision-tree to see what the rules are for the dependent variable. What kind of visualization might be the best ones to go with. What the data rules are? What is impacting my dependent variable the most is the top branch of a decision-tree.
