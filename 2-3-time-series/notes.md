# Time series analysis
Time series analysis is focused on analyzing one variable that changes over time. This could be anything from stock prices, to weather patterns, to the number of visitors of a website. They key is that the time series data is measure at regular time intervals. 

# Time series vs Machine Learning
Time series and ML are both techniques used in data analysis, however, time series analysis is more specific in its use-case as it handles time-dependent data measured in specific regular time intervals. When analyzing time series data, there are usually 3 different types of powers that can affect the data and those are: trend, seasonal, and random. We decompose the dataset into these 3 powers and study them separately using time series analysis. 

# 3 Powers affecting the data
The trend component represents a long-term increase or decrease in the data over time. The seasonal component represents regular, repeating patterns in the data that occur at fixed intervals. The random component represents the residual variation in the data that cannot be explained by the trend or seasonal components.

# Business Usecases
- To better understand the time series analysis, we can decompose the data into its trend, seasonal, and random components and study each component separately. 
- Sales forecasting - we can see when we should be ready for an increase/decrease in demand because of some seasonality over the year or any other regular time intervals (depends on what we are selling).
- Website traffic analysis - websites generate a lot of user information. We can use that information, decomponse it into trend, seasonal, and random powers and then focus our marketing efforts accordingly.
