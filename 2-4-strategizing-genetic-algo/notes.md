# Prescriptive analytics
- Type of data analysis focused on making recommendations or decisions based on predictions made by predictive analytics
- Having a prediction is like checking a weather, strategy is the decision whether I want to take an umbrella or not
- In the case of website traffic analysis, predictive analytics would be use to forecast the future traffic of a website, and prescriptive analytics would be used to take the forecasted traffic data and recommend specific strategies or actions to improve the selected variable (conversion, traffic) by optimizing some of the other variables that impact the selected one
- Prescriptive analytics is often used with mathematical optimization techniques which are algorithms used to find the optimal solution to a problem, given a set of constraints (costs of improving the website for example)
- Control over some of the independent variables are the places where I want to take action to move my dependent variable the way I want it to move

# Genetic Algorithms
- One approach to mathematical optimization is a technique called Genetic Algorithms
- Inspired by the process of natural selection in genetics using mutation and crossover to evolve the population of solution over multiple generations

## Usecases of prescriptive analytics
- In the athletics department, they have these machines that can tell the likelihood of an athlete getting injured just by measuring the way they jump, land, 
what is their weight, height, and body composition. I assume that these machines use some sort of machine learning and that there are also others which are able to prescribe treatment or recommend a treatment based on the analysis of our bodies. Furthermore, face recognition, sentiment analysis can even assess our mental states and prescribe recommended action.
